- Credential sub-types (Password, SSH Key) open dedicated credential form with vault unlock handling

### Credential Management
- Username/password storage
- SSH private key storage
- Windows domain credentials
- Credential picker for linking to connection entries
- Tags for organization
- **Credential types**: Typed credentials with extensible type system
  - **Generic**: Default type for username/password/domain/private key

  - Type badge shown in credential list and picker for non-generic types
  - Type selector in credential form (segmented button group)
  - SSH key metadata section (public key with copy button, read-only fingerprint) shown when SSH Key type selected
- **TOTP (One-Time Password)**: Optional MFA/TOTP support on generic credentials
  - TOTP secret encrypted at same level as passwords (AES-256-GCM)
  - Two setup paths: import QR code image, or manually enter Base32 secret key
  - QR code decoder (reads PNG/JPG/GIF/BMP/WebP images via `jsqr` + `sharp`)
  - Live TOTP code preview in credential form with real-time countdown
  - Dashboard display: large monospace code with circular SVG countdown arc and copy button

  - Auto-refreshes every second with visual countdown indicator (turns red at 5s)
  - Works with team vault sync (encrypted with VEK alongside other secrets)
  - MCP tools include `has_totp` flag in credential list/read responses

### Entry Organization
- Hierarchical folder structure (unlimited depth)
- Move entries between folders
- **Nested entries**: Any entry can be nested under another entry — e.g. drop a credential onto a web session, an SSH command under a host, a document under a project. Children promote to the parent's container when the parent is deleted, so nothing is orphaned.
- **Multi-select**: Ctrl/Cmd+Click to select multiple entries and folders
- **Batch drag-and-drop**: Drag multiple selected items into a folder (or onto a parent entry) at once, with "N items" badge on drag
- Circular reference protection (cannot drag a folder into its own descendant, or an entry under itself)
- Team vault permission enforcement on batch moves (insufficient-permission items skipped with toast)
- Root drop zone below tree for moving items to top level
- **Recursive folder deletion**: Deleting a folder deletes all its contents (subfolders + entries) with a confirmation dialog showing the total item count
- Multi-delete with count confirmation dialog (Delete/Backspace key)
- Multi-select context menu with batch delete option
- Click empty tree area to clear selection
- Drag disabled in search/favorites flat-list mode
- Favorite/star marking with visual star indicator in tree

- Tags, descriptions
- Markdown notes with GitHub-style Write/Preview editor, formatting toolbar, and `!!secret!!` syntax for masking sensitive inline text

### Auto-Lock
- Configurable inactivity timeout (0 to unlimited minutes, default 5)
- Automatic vault lock after inactivity
- Manual lock via menu or Cmd+Shift+L
- UI notification on auto-lock

### Quick Unlock (Biometric)
- **Touch ID / Apple Watch unlock** (macOS): Unlock personal vaults using Touch ID, Apple Watch, or system password instead of re-entering the master password
- Uses macOS LAContext `deviceOwnerAuthentication` policy via compiled Swift helper binary (supports Touch ID, Apple Watch, and passcode fallback)
- Master password stored encrypted in macOS Keychain via Electron's `safeStorage` API
- Per-vault biometric enrollment — setup prompt appears after first successful password unlock
- Dismissed prompt tracking per vault (switching vaults re-prompts)
- Quick Unlock button in UnlockDialog for manual re-trigger after auto-prompt
- Fingerprint badge on biometric-enabled vaults in Vault Hub
- Settings > Security tab with Quick Unlock toggle (macOS only)
- Auto-updates stored password on vault password change
- Cleans up biometric data when removing vaults from recents
- Team vaults excluded (VEK-based, no master password)
- Zero new npm dependencies — uses Electron built-in + compiled Swift binary
- Windows Hello support planned as follow-up

### Vault Management
- **Rename Vault**: Rename personal or team vaults from File > Rename Vault while unlocked; personal vaults rename the `.conduit` file on disk, team vaults update the name in Supabase (vault admin or team admin required)
- **Manual Save**: File > Vault Management > Save Vault (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S) forces a WAL checkpoint, flushing all data into the `.conduit` file for portable backup; shows informational toast for team vaults (saved to cloud automatically)

### Local Backup
- Encrypted local folder backup with AES-256-GCM (domain-separated from cloud/vault encryption)
- User-selectable backup folder via native OS folder picker
- Debounced automatic backup on vault mutation (5s after last change)
- Manual "Backup Now" trigger
- Configurable retention period (default 30 days) with automatic pruning
- Atomic writes (write to .tmp, then rename) for crash safety
- Backup file list with timestamps, sizes, and per-file delete
- Periodic prune every 6 hours for long-running sessions
- Descriptive error states (ENOENT, EACCES, ENOSPC)
- No authentication required — works with just the master password
- Dedicated "Backup" settings tab consolidating all backup functionality

### Team & Shared Vaults (Zero-Knowledge)
- **Zero-knowledge encryption**: X25519 identity key pairs per user-device, ECIES VEK wrapping
- **Vault Encryption Key (VEK)**: Per-vault 256-bit AES key, wrapped individually for each authorized user
- **Recovery passphrase**: 6-word BIP39-style passphrase for cross-device key backup
- **Device authorization**: Approve new devices from existing ones via device-to-device key transfer
- **Team entity management**: Teams with admin/member roles, invitation system with accept/decline
- **Team vaults**: Create and share encrypted vaults within a team (no shared password)
- **Entry-level cloud sync**: Supabase Realtime for live entry/folder updates across devices
- **Offline mutation queue**: Queues changes when offline, flushes on reconnect (1000 op cap)
- **Optimistic concurrency**: Version-checked writes with last-write-wins conflict resolution
- **Full reconciliation**: Periodic 5-minute sync to catch missed Realtime events
- **VEK rotation**: Re-encrypt all entries when a member is removed
- **Pro vault locking**: Exclusive lock with 60s TTL and 30s heartbeat (Team plan: concurrent access)
- **Network share advisory locking**: .lock file with stale detection for shared-drive vaults
- **Network file watcher**: mtime polling (3s) for network paths, fs.watch() for local paths
- **Folder-level permissions**: Admin/editor/viewer roles per folder with restrict-only inheritance (folder overrides can only downgrade, never escalate beyond vault role)
- **Audit trail**: Fire-and-forget logging of all team vault mutations (entry/folder CRUD, member add/remove/role change, vault create/access/key rotation, folder permission grant/revoke, invitation accept/decline), filterable log viewable by admins, 2-year retention policy with automatic server-side purge
- **Sync status indicator**: Real-time sync state in sidebar (synced/syncing/offline/error)
- **Team invitation banner**: Amber notification in sidebar for pending team invitations
- **Unified vault switcher**: Combined personal and team vault dropdown with active indicator, member counts, and quick-switch between vault types
- **Team vault creation from desktop**: Create team vaults directly from the vault switcher or Team settings tab (admin only), with automatic identity key generation if needed
- **Team vault member management**: Full CRUD dialog for vault members — add from team roster, change roles (admin/editor/viewer) via dedicated update IPC, remove members, rotate vault encryption key, and last-admin protection
- **Identity key onboarding**: Auto-detect new devices that need identity key setup, with recovery passphrase entry or device-to-device authorization
- **Team vault context bar**: Theme-aware accent bar shown when a team vault is active, displaying sync status, member count, and quick-access buttons for members/audit/settings
- **Theme-aware team indicators**: Team vault accent colors derived from the active color scheme (Ocean, Ember, Forest, Amethyst, Rose, Midnight) via CSS custom properties
- **Device authorization approval**: Auto-polls for pending device auth requests every 30s, shows approval dialog with approve/deny actions on existing devices
- **Folder permission editor**: Right-click folders in team vaults to manage per-member permissions (admin only) — add, change role (filtered by vault role ceiling), or remove access
- **Vault Hub**: Full-screen landing page on launch (like VS Code Welcome) showing team vaults and recent personal vaults; auto-connects to last team vault for team-plan users when online; fallback to hub on offline, error, or personal vault last used; lock/close vault returns to hub instead of showing unlock dialog; offline team vaults shown greyed with "Offline" badge; "Switch Vault..." option in vault dropdown
- **Vault settings dialog**: Centralized tabbed dialog (Members + Folder Permissions) accessible from context bar, replaces separate member/permission dialogs
- **Auto-enrollment of team admins**: Team admins are automatically enrolled in new vaults at creation time; promoted members are enrolled in all existing vaults; late-joining admins (who set up identity keys after vault creation) are auto-enrolled when any existing admin opens the vault
- **Client-side permission enforcement**: Viewers see disabled create buttons, filtered context menus (no edit/delete), read-only warning banners in dialogs, and lock icons on restricted folders
- **Effective role computation**: `min(vault_role, folder_override)` with restrict-only semantics — folder permissions can only downgrade access, enforced both client-side and via Supabase trigger
- **Cascading role downgrade**: When a vault member's role is reduced, folder permissions exceeding the new ceiling are automatically pruned
- **Pro vault lock dialog**: When a Pro-tier user tries to open a vault locked by another user, shows lock holder info with retry/upgrade options
- **Admin onboarding card**: Dismissible sidebar prompt for team admins with no vaults, guiding first vault creation
- **Empty state guidance**: Non-admin team members see helpful text explaining that admins create vaults; Team settings shows admin names to contact
- **Network vault indicator**: Auto-detects vaults on network shares and shows a network icon in the vault switcher with tooltip
- **Vault entry isolation**: Switching vaults fully isolates entries — sidebar shows only the active vault's entries, folders, and credentials
- **Vault context in dialogs**: Entry and folder creation/edit dialogs show which vault the item will be saved to (personal vault filename or team vault name with badge)
- **Team vault empty state**: Fresh team vaults display a dedicated empty state with guidance text instead of the generic "No entries yet"
- **Team vault tier skip**: Team vault entries are exempt from personal tier connection limits

## AI & Chat

Conduit ships with a unified engine architecture that hosts external CLI
agents (Claude Code, Codex) in a rich chat UI and exposes all Conduit
capabilities to those agents via an MCP server. There is no built-in
Conduit AI model — users bring their own agent subscription.

### Engine Architecture
- Two engines: **Claude Code** (Anthropic) and **Codex** (OpenAI), each running under the user's own subscription
- Engine selector tabs in chat panel header with brand icons (Claude spark, OpenAI knot)
- Claude Agent SDK integration: async generator streaming with rich structured output
- Codex App Server integration: JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout child process
- Rich message blocks: text (markdown), tool calls, file edits, file creates, shell commands, approval requests
- Engine availability detection (CLI installed + authenticated checks)
- Approval flow for agent operations (approve/deny inline in chat)
- Default engine setting (persisted in settings, applied on startup)
- Default working directory for agent sessions
- Slash commands: `/model`, `/clear`, `/cost`, `/help` with autocomplete popup
- Per-session token usage tracking (input + output tokens)
- System messages for command feedback (distinct styling from agent responses)
- Edit/retry for engine messages (edit user messages or regenerate assistant responses)
  - Claude Code: clears SDK session context and resends from edit point
  - Codex: uses `thread/rollback` to preserve context before the edit point
- Conversation history is owned by the underlying CLI (Claude Code / Codex) — the desktop app no longer maintains its own duplicate history layer

### Terminal Mode
- Launch Claude Code / Codex as native CLI terminals instead of the rich chat interface
- Configurable font size
- Same MCP tool access (the agent connects to Conduit via the MCP server just like the rich mode)

### Tier System
- `cli_agents_enabled`: Claude Code / Codex access (all tiers — under the user's own Anthropic / OpenAI subscription)
- `mcp_enabled`: MCP tool access (all tiers — Free is daily-quota capped at 50/day)
- `mcp_daily_quota`: per-day MCP tool call cap (Free = 50, Pro/Team = -1 unlimited)
- `cloud_sync_enabled`: vault cloud sync across devices (Pro + Team)
- `shared_vaults`: multi-user shared vaults (Team only)
- `is_team_member`: team membership flag (UI/team vault logic only)
- Cached tier capabilities for offline mode

### Tier Enforcement & Downgrade Handling
- Entry creation limit enforcement (frontend + backend defense-in-depth)
- Credentials excluded from entry limit (only connection types count)
- Downgrade detection: periodic profile refresh (5-min interval + window focus)
- Tier change notification toast on plan downgrades/upgrades with app relaunch button
- Locked entry UX: lock icon + dimmed styling for entries beyond tier limit
- Oldest entries (by created_at) remain accessible; newer entries get locked
- Locked entries: restricted context menu (upgrade prompt + delete only)
- Double-click on locked entry shows upgrade prompt
- Active session cleanup: sessions on newly-locked entries auto-disconnect with notification
- Deleting entries frees up slots (locked entries become accessible)
- MCP gatekeeper: IPC socket server runs whenever `mcp_enabled` is true OR in local mode
  - Server starts/stops dynamically on auth state changes (sign in, sign out, tier change)
  - Socket file deleted on stop to prevent external connection attempts
  - Defense-in-depth: tier check on all IPC requests
- MCP daily quota (WS2a): rolling 24-hour counter enforced in the MCP server
  - Free tier: 50 tool calls / day; Pro and Team: unlimited
  - Storage: `{userData}/conduit[-dev]/mcp-quota.json`, atomic writes
  - Structured quota-exceeded error with `upgradeUrl` and `resetAt`
- Local mode: MCP enabled with Free-tier (50/day) quota
- Team members: unlimited everything
- **30-day free trial**: CC-required trial for Pro and Team plans
  - One trial per user (Pro OR Team, not both); `has_used_trial` flag prevents re-trials
  - Team trials capped at 3 seats (checkout, seat adjustment, invite acceptance)
  - Sidebar: trial promotion card for eligible free users, countdown card for active trials
  - Auth screen: trial highlight banner above sign-in card
  - Settings Account tab: trial progress bar with days remaining and Subscribe Now CTA
  - UpgradeGate: "Start Free Trial" CTA when trial-eligible
  - Toast warnings at 7/3/1 days before trial ends
  - Trial conversion detection: success toast when trial converts to paid, warning when expired
  - Trial eligibility excludes team members and users already on Pro/Team tiers
  - App relaunch button on all plan change toasts for full state refresh
- **Contextual upgrade nudges**: Tasteful upgrade prompts at natural friction points
  - AI chat panel: full-panel split-layout gate showing Pro features when `aiChatEnabled` is false
  - Engine selector: "Pro" badge on Claude Code/Codex buttons; clicking opens pricing page
  - Entry tree: inline banner when connection limit reached with upgrade CTA
  - Context menu: "Upgrade to Access" on locked entries opens pricing page (replaces toast)
  - Vault Hub: split-card Team Vaults upgrade section for signed-in non-team members
  - Vault switcher: compact "Upgrade to Teams" row for non-team members
  - Pro vault lock dialog: split layout with benefits column alongside lock info
  - Settings AI tab: banner when AI features require Pro
  - All prompts hidden in local mode and for team members
  - Free → Pro CTAs open `/pricing`; Pro → Team CTAs open `/account`

## MCP Server

Standalone MCP server process exposes Conduit tools to AI agents (Claude Code, etc.).

### Tool Categories
- **Terminal**: execute commands, read pane buffer (continuous scrollback — pass `lines` for tail size), send keys, create local shell with optional `working_directory`
- **RDP**: screenshot (returns native + image dims atomically), click, type, send key (press/down/up), mouse move, drag, scroll, resize (RDPEDISP), get dimensions
- **VNC**: screenshot (returns native dims atomically), click, type, send key (press/down/up), mouse move, drag, scroll, get dimensions
- **Web**: screenshot (returns viewport + image dims atomically), read content, navigate (with `wait_until` = `load`/`domcontentloaded`/`networkidle`), click, type, send key (press/down/up), mouse move, drag, scroll, get dimensions, click element (CSS selector), fill input (CSS selector), get interactive elements, execute JavaScript
- **Web Tab Management**: list tabs, create tab, close tab, switch tab, go back, go forward, reload — enables AI agents to manage multiple browser tabs per web session
- **Credentials**: list, create, read (with approval), delete, generate SSH key pair (`ssh_key_generate` — generates ed25519/RSA/ECDSA, stores encrypted in vault, returns only the public key + fingerprint)
- **Connections**: list (active and saved), open (SSH/RDP/VNC), close (also drops cached coordinate scale factors so a reopen under the same id can't reuse stale scale)
- **Entry**: get metadata for any vault entry with optional notes (!!secret!! values auto-redacted), update entry notes, list entries (filter by `entry_type` / `folder_id` / `tags`), search entries (case-insensitive substring on name and host)
- **Document**: read, create, and update markdown document entries (!!secret!! values auto-redacted on read)

### Safety & Controls
- **Local-socket isolation**: MCP server speaks over a Unix socket (or named pipe on Windows) created with `0o600` permissions — only the user that owns the Conduit process can connect. Nothing is exposed over the network.
- **Per-tool rate limiting**: Token-bucket limits sized per tool (e.g. screenshots 30/min, click/type 60/min, ssh_key_generate 6/min). Every registered tool has an explicit limit; nothing falls through to a generic default.
- **Daily quota enforcement**: Free tier capped at 50 tool calls / day, enforced inside the MCP process. Pro and Team get unlimited. Quota state lives at `{userData}/conduit[-dev]/mcp-quota.json`.
- **Tier-aware gatekeeper**: IPC server only accepts connections when `mcp_enabled` is true (or in local mode). Socket file is removed on stop; defense-in-depth tier check on every IPC request.
- **Credential approval**: `credential_read` still requires explicit user approval with a `purpose` reason — this is the one tool that reveals raw secrets, so the approval dialog is preserved.
- **Audit logging**: Every tool invocation (success, error, rate-limited, quota-exceeded) is logged with timing, args summary, and caller.
- **Secret redaction**: `!!secret!!…!!secret!!` blocks in entry notes and document content are redacted to `********` before being returned by `entry_info` / `document_read`.
- Standalone operation fallback (MCP server stays alive if the main app's connection blips — reconnects on next request)

### External Agent Instructions (Auto-Generated)
- Auto-generates `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code with MCP setup instructions and tool reference
- Auto-generates `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` for Codex CLI (only if Codex is installed or `~/.codex/` exists)
- Marker-based sections (`<!-- conduit-managed-start/end -->`) preserve user content in existing files
- Regenerated on every app launch with current version, socket path, and environment config
- Includes categorized tool reference built dynamically from the tool registry

---

## Import

### Vault Export/Import (.conduit-export)
- Export full vault or individual folders to encrypted `.conduit-export` files
- User-provided passphrase encryption (PBKDF2-SHA256, 600k iterations, AES-256-GCM)
- Domain-separated key derivation (`conduit-export-v1`) to prevent key reuse
- Decrypt and preview before importing (shows source vault, folder tree, entry type counts)
- Import into vault root or specific target folder
- Fresh UUID generation for all imported entries/folders (safe to re-import)
- Credential reference remapping for included credentials, clearing for external refs
- Works across personal and team vaults (team sync auto-picks up imported entries)
- Topological folder creation order (parents before children)
- Export from vault switcher menu or folder context menu
- Import from vault switcher menu

### Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager (.rdm)
- File picker for .rdm (XML) export files

## Team Management (Website)

Team administration is handled on conduitdesktop.com. The desktop app is team-aware but defers management to the website.

### Team Lifecycle
- **Creation**: Team setup form with name, slug (auto-generated, editable), seat count (1-100), billing interval (monthly/annual)
- **Stripe checkout**: Per-seat subscription (pricing managed in production Supabase `tiers` table — run `SELECT name, price_monthly, price_annual FROM tiers ORDER BY sort_order;` for current values)
- **Webhook provisioning**: On successful checkout, webhook creates the team, adds owner as admin, sets tier to Team
- **Pro upgrade path**: Users upgrading from Pro receive prorated credit; old subscription auto-canceled
- **Dissolution**: Canceling team subscription downgrades all members to Free, removes memberships

### Team Dashboard (`/account/team`)
- Team name, slug, role badge (Admin/Member)
- Seat usage display (members + pending invitations vs. max seats)
- Inline seat adjustment with prorated cost preview
- Member list with avatars, roles, and admin controls (role toggle, remove)
- Pending invitations with revoke capability
- Billing management link (Stripe Customer Portal)
- "Team created!" banner on successful checkout redirect

### Invitations
- Email-based invitation system with admin/member role selection
- 7-day expiring tokens (auto-generated by DB)
- Invitation emails sent via Resend with branded dark-theme template
- Acceptance flow: validates token, checks expiration, prevents multi-team membership
- On accept: adds member, sets tier to Team, increments Stripe seat quantity
- Decline and admin revoke supported
- Pending invitations shown to recipients on their account page with accept/decline

### Seat Management
- Admins can adjust seat count (1-100) from the dashboard
- Cannot reduce below current members + pending invitations
- Stripe subscription quantity updated with prorations
- "Add Seats" button prominently shown when at capacity
- Inline "Add a Seat" option in invite form when seats exhausted

### Member Management
- Role changes (admin ↔ member) with last-admin protection
- Member removal downgrades removed user to Free tier, decrements Stripe quantity
- Owner cannot be removed (protected in API)
- Self-removal not allowed (prevents accidental team abandonment)

### Owner Self-Add (`/api/team/add-self`)
- Idempotent endpoint for team owner to ensure they're in `team_members`
- Repair mechanism if webhook failed to insert owner
- Sets profile tier and primary_team_id

### Constraints
- One team per user (enforced on invite accept and team creation)
- Only team admins can invite, revoke, change roles, adjust seats, manage billing
- Team owner is immutable — dissolution requires subscription cancellation
- Email-tied invitations must match authenticated user's email

## Settings & Preferences

### Window
- Remember window size and position across launches (persisted in ui-state.json)
- Maximized state restored on relaunch
- Position validated against connected displays (falls back to centered if saved position is offscreen)

### Appearance
- Theme: dark, light, system
- Color scheme selection: 6 universal schemes (Ocean, Ember, Forest, Amethyst, Rose, Midnight)
- **Platform themes**: Full platform-native look & feel with 4 selectable themes:

## UI & UX

### Splash Screen
- Native HTML splash screen shown immediately on launch before React mounts
- Branded loading state eliminates blank white flash during app initialization
- Fades out (400ms transition) once React is ready

### Onboarding
- Tier-aware onboarding wizard for first-time authenticated users
- Free tier: 4 steps (Welcome, Vault, Connections, Organization)
- Pro tier: 7 steps (adds AI Assistant, MCP Tools, Cloud Sync)
- Teams tier: 10 steps (adds Team Vaults, Permissions, Audit Trail)
- Full-screen wizard with GIF placeholder areas, dot indicators, prev/next navigation
- Skip option available at any point
- Existing users see onboarding already completed (settings migration)
- Replayable via "Getting Started" button in Help dialog

### Sidebar
- Connection tree (hierarchical folders + entries)
- Filter by name/type
- Favorites filter toggle with persisted state
- Favorites-only view groups favorited entries by folder path
- **Search results grouped by folder**: Search results display entries organized by their folder path (e.g., "Servers / Production"), making it easy to distinguish entries with the same name in different folders
- Context menu: open, edit, duplicate, copy host, move, delete
- Inline folder creation

### Tab Bar
- Multi-session tabs
- Close tab (Cmd+W)
- Tab navigation: next (Cmd+Tab), previous (Cmd+Shift+Tab)
- Active tab highlighting

### Split-View Pane Layout
- **Drag-to-split**: Drag a tab from the tab bar to any edge of the content area to split into side-by-side or stacked panes
- **Drop zones**: Five drop targets (center, left, right, top, bottom) with theme-aware visual feedback (`conduit-500` accent highlights)
- **Binary tree layout**: Panes organized as a binary tree (branch = split, leaf = pane) via `react-resizable-panels`
- **Per-pane tab bars**: Each pane has its own tab bar with close, reorder, and context menu actions
- **Tab reordering**: Drag tabs within a pane to reorder, or across panes to move sessions
- **Context menu split**: Right-click a tab → "Split Right" or "Split Down" to move it to a new split
- **Pane auto-collapse**: Closing the last tab in a pane collapses it, promoting the sibling to fill the space
- **Resize handles**: Draggable dividers between panes with hover-highlight feedback
- **Restore to full screen**: Closing all split panes returns to single-pane layout
- **Focused pane tracking**: Click inside a pane to set focus; focused pane has a top accent border
- **Session preservation**: Terminal and command sessions (xterm.js instances) preserved across split/collapse via global registries — no loss of scrollback or history
- **RDP resize**: Immediate CSS scaling on split, followed by debounced native RDPEDISP resize with HiDPI/Retina support
- **Terminal resize**: FitAddon recomputes rows/cols on container resize; backend notified via `terminal_resize`
- **Layout-changed event**: All session types listen for `conduit:layout-changed` to adapt to pane size changes
- **Native webview handling**: Webviews hidden during drag operations to prevent overlay conflicts with drop zones
- **New session from pane**: "+" button in pane tab bar to create a new local shell session directly in that pane

  - Access notes, credentials, TOTP codes, and connection details even while sessions are open
  - Also available from the session tab right-click menu ("View Info")
  - Deduplicates: only one info tab per entry, re-selecting activates the existing tab
  - "Open Session" button in the info tab creates a real session as a separate tab

### Context Menus
- Theme-aware custom context menus
